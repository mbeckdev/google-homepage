# Google Homepage

I remade the google homepage to practice using HTML and CSS. It doesn't work to search anything, but it looks just like it!

## Note to self - things to remember

* Problem - footer was being written over everything when I shrunk the height.
  *  Solution - when the height gets small, change the footer from position:absolute to position:relative

* Problem - The three footer sections are fine until the width gets really large, then make them all in one line - but they're out of order
  * Solution - use the order:1  order:2 order:3 on each section in order to switch them around
